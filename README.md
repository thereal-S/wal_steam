## About

`wal_steam` is a tiny program that is meant to work with either `wal` or `wpgtk`, by reading the colors they generate and making a color theme for a slightly tweaked version of Metro for Steam.

**Disclaimer:** Steam isn't nearly as "theme-able" as it once was. Over the
years many of the UI elements that we used to be able to change with themes with
be re-written with hard-coding to use steam's default blue theme. As a result
`wal_steam` has gotten noticably worse since I originally wrote it. I'll accept
pull requests when I have time to test them, but this project is very low
priority to me since I barely use Steam anymore. I suggest getting your games on
itch, gog, or humble.

[Wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) is a little program for linux that creates a terminal color scheme based on your wallpaper (in addition to being able to set the wallpaper and a few other
interesting features).

[Wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk) is based on wal, but with the added feature of being able to generate gtk themes with the colors and bring a nice simple ui to wal.

[Metro for steam](http://metroforsteam.com/) is a very nice looking skin for steam. We also add the [community patch](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroskin/discussions/0/141136086931804907) which makes the skin render well on linux.

## Install

**Note for Windows users:** You're going to need to install [python 3](https://www.python.org/) then [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php) first. Then search for command prompt, right click it and open as administrator, then run the pip command below but without the sudo part.

### Packages

**Python PIP:** `sudo pip3 install wal-steam`

**Arch Linux AUR:** `yay -S python-wal-steam-git`

### Manual

**Pre-install:** Make sure [Wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) or [Wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk) is installed and working.

**Install:** `git clone https://github.com/kotajacob/wal_steam.git`

**Post-install:** See the "Using" section of this readme.

## Using

**Make sure you've run wal or wpgk at least once to generate the colors and set the wallpaper.**

**Note:** On some distros, notably **Ubuntu** you'll have to run the command python3 instead of python or you'll have an error about failing to import urllib.request. Additionally, OSx users may   need to use the system certificate store (outlined [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41691327/ssl-sslerror-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-certificate-verify-failed-ssl-c)).

If you cloned the repo all you need to do is run the script with python 3 from wherever you downloaded it.

Example:

`wal_steam -w`

```
Usage:
  wal_steam.py (-w | -g | -u) [-d]
  wal_steam.py ( -s ) ["/home/kota/bin/custom_steam_install/skins/"]
  wal_steam.py (-h | --help)
  wal_steam.py (-v | --version)
  wal_steam.py (-f | --fonts) ["Ubuntu, Ubuntu Bold, Ubuntu Medium, Ubuntu Light"]

  -h --help            show this help message and exit
  -v --version         show version and exit
  -w                   use wal for colors
  -g                   use wpg for colors
  -u                   force update cache and config file
  -d                   apply HiDPI community patch
